Tasks Completed:

- Creation of the project's basic structure: The main structure of the project was designed and organized, including the fundamental sections and divisions. 
This provided a solid foundation for future development and allowed us to visualize how the final product would look.
- Initial CSS styling: Basic styles were implemented using CSS to give a consistent appearance to the different sections of the project.

Challenges Faced:

- Organization of the site structure:

    Problem: Creating the site structure was particularly challenging, as we needed to organize the elements in a way that was both appropriate and functional for end-users.
    Solution: To overcome this difficulty, the team carefully studied the original website on which our project is based. 
    This research allowed us to establish a reasonable and coherent structure.

- Dropdown menu:

    Problem: During the implementation of the dropdown menu, difficulties arose in getting it to work correctly.
    Solution: After reviewing relevant documentation, consulting with ChatGPT, and watching several tutorials on YouTube, we successfully implemented a functional dropdown menu.

- Overlaying an image with text:

    Problem: A challenge emerged when trying to overlay an image with text while applying a blur effect to the image.
    Solution: Similar to the dropdown menu, this was resolved by reviewing documentation, consulting with ChatGPT, 
    and watching videos on YouTube. The blur effect was successfully applied to the image while keeping the text clear and legible.
