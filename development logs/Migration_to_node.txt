- Addition of MongoDB: MongoDB was added to manage the database, allowing us to handle a large volume of data more efficiently.
- Bootstrap Enhancement: I improved the websiteâ€™s design and layout using Bootstrap. 
This included refining the visual presentation while ensuring compatibility with the older version of Bootstrap that the project used.
- Pagination Implementation: Implemented pagination for a table containing approximately 12,000 records,
ensuring the data was displayed efficiently without overloading the system.

Challenges Faced:

- Bootstrap Version Conflicts:
    Problem: The project was using an older version of Bootstrap, and several elements did not work as expected with the newer design updates.
    Solution: I resolved this by reviewing the Bootstrap documentation, reverting to compatible versions, and making necessary adjustments to ensure proper functionality.

- Table Pagination:
    Problem: Paginating the table with 12,000 records posed performance issues and difficulties in displaying data efficiently.
