serve as the backbone for the ongoing development of the project.

Self-Assessment:

- Tasks Completed: I was in charge of designing the basic structure of the project, a process that was both challenging and rewarding. 
  Translating ideas into a web page proved to be more complex than I initially expected. 
  Itâ€™s not just about organizing elements logically but ensuring they are functional and aesthetically pleasing. 
  However, after overcoming this challenge, I could see how the ideas took shape within the project, which was a very gratifying experience.

- Personal Reflection: This deliverable reminded me of an important lesson: with patience and dedication, anything is possible. 
  As my good friend Taboada used to say, "If you can imagine it, you can code it." 
  This mindset was key to staying motivated and focused throughout the design process.

- Performance Evaluation: I believe that my performance and contribution to this deliverable have been good. 
  Despite facing some external situations that limited my availability, I feel that I have been able to add value to the team.
  My focus has been consistently on ensuring that the basic structure is solid and functional, and I am satisfied with the results achieved so far.

Reflection on Teammates' Work: From my perspective, the team has been working excellently. 
Each member has shown they are more than capable of moving this project forward with outstanding quality.
