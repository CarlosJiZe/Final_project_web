#Personal log Martin Garcia

During this deliverable I was focused in checking the progress of the page and
the changing in the website. Also I help with the part of the desing and 
deleting some extra info that is irrelevant.

Task Failed:
I tried to implement some bootstrap in the proyect, trying that some images
deploy informaci√≥n and grafics but i couldnt make it right and i ended update
deleting all the bootstrap try.

Personal Reflection: In the delivery i think that my aportation were cero but, at the end i was helping not only with thee code
or creating the repository, but i help my team seeing some issues with the page, like the color, the format, helping with some issues
that my team have with some anchors and the display.

Performance Evaluation: I feel that i didnt work as much as my teamates, but thinking in deep all the things we change in the pryect 
since the begining i think that my work was more in the ideas and the supervision more than making the web.

Reflection on teamates Work: My team is the best they work in time and in forms also they make this possible and all 
their ideas were creative and all posible.
