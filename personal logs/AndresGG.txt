#Pesonal log: Andres Gonzalez Gomez

My main focus during this face of the project was visual design and usage of color. Since 
functionality isn't our priority yet, I tried to make the visual aspect of the website as 
polished as possible.

Self-Assessment:

- Tasks Completed: I used the bases we built to create a cleaner page using a specific 
color scheme and visual elements for the structure of the items. I searched for useful 
assets in bootstrap and modified them to our needs.

- Personal Reflection: Since I am better at design than back-end programming I will use 
those skills to make myself useful. I'll be working with data in future deliveries while
keeping the aesthetic of our webpage.

- Performance Evaluation: I'd say my performance wasn't as good as I would've like'd it to
be, since I've been short on time this past weeks. However, I try to work on this proyect 
whenever I can and I'm in constant contact with my team to discuss it.

Reflection on Teammates' Work: My team's performance has been more than ideal since they're
both willing to go that extra mile so our proyect has the quality we want. They are great
programmers and I look forward to what we can create as a team.
